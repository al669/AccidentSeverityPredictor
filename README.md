Project Description This project focuses on predicting the severity of accidents using a dataset from Kaggle called RTA.csv. Initially, 
the dataset has 12,316 rows and 32 columns. After careful data wrangling, itâ€™s streamlined to 19 columns to enhance the analysis.

To understand the data better, I created several visualizations:

A graph showing the number of vehicles involved in accidents. A heat map illustrating the relationship between the number of vehicles and casualties. A pie chart depicting the proportion of accident severities: "fatal injury," "serious injury," and "slight injury." For the prediction model, I used Logistic Regression, achieving an accuracy of 85%. This helps in effectively classifying the accidents based on their severity.

In this repository, you will find the RTA.csv dataset and a Jupyter Notebook that walks you through the entire process of data wrangling, visualization, and model implementation.
